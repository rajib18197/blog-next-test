        To Place Simply, aggregation of our entire application code + the React
        library's code + 3rd party libraries condensed into one JavaScript file
        makes a bundle.

      <p>
        To Make a better user experince, we can divide the bundle into multiple
        parts and download them when needed. This would lead to the faster
        initial load times as users don't have to download that one huge bundle.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example If an app has 5 pages, then downloading them at once burden
        the pressure into users computer and what else - user might not visit
        the all 6 pages in this situation. So to prevent that we could split
        each pages and download them individually when user need them. So now
        the bundle has divided into 5 parts. This is called code splitting.

Mental model stays simple. Everything is a simple function. My app is one big
function composed of smaller and smaller ones. It trully sounds great! But in
a real world, hooks are not so simple, homogen and composable. There are
obstacles and limits mainly because of rule of hooks. This post is not about
saying React hooks are bad. I wrote it because I did not find any resources on
such obstacles and limits. The React world looks like hooks are always
pleasant walk trought the rosy garden. But they are not. For now I don't know
how to elegantly solve the recusrion example. Are there some resources on
this? Do you have following thougts? Maybe I'm not the only one struggling.
Thanks for reading.
