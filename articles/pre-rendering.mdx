<div style={{ backgroundColor: "violet", padding: "1rem" }}>
  Try and change the Counter to `tomato`.
</div>

<Counter />

<div className="notes">
	<div className="notes__title">
	<span>Important</span>
	</div>

    <p className="notes__description">It took me lot of hours, **sweating** `over the nuances` and countless days of studying and practice of computer science and web development concepts for understanding what they do and what problems they solve to build something ecstatic.</p>

</div>

```
import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button
      className="dark:color-white rounded-lg bg-purple-700 px-2 py-1 font-sans font-semibold text-white focus:ring active:bg-purple-600"
      onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}
    >
      You clicked me {count} times
    </button>
  );
}

```

Next.js (The Beautiful Framework) has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
