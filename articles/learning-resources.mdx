If you're new to React, it may come as a surprise to know that a router isn't baked into the library itself, but that's foundational to React's ethos. React focuses on giving you UI primitives for building your application, and nothing more.

It's probably no surprise to you that React Router is the most popular 3rd party library in the React ecosystem. In fact, during the last 6 months, React Router has been included in [44%](https:\react-router.com) of all React projects. This statistic alone is enough to declare React Router as essential knowledge for any serious React developer.

The problem, honestly, lies in the fact that no one wants to spend their weekend learning about a router â€“ regardless of how popular it is. To make that pill a little easier to swallow, this post is a culmination of everything you'll need to know in order to be effective with React Router.

In this React Router tutorial, we'll start off with a high-level look at what React Router is. From there we'll dive into the fundamentals of the API. Finally, we'll finish off looking at a few lot of different use cases you may face in the real-world.

<div style={{ backgroundColor: "violet", padding: "1rem" }}>
  Try and change the Counter to `tomato`.
</div>

<Counter />

<div className="notes">
	<h3 className="notes__title">
	<span>Important</span>
	</h3>

    <p className="notes__description">It took me lot of hours, **sweating** `over the nuances` and countless days of studying and practice of computer science and web development concepts for understanding what they do and what problems they solve to build something ecstatic.</p>

</div>

```
import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button
      className="dark:color-white rounded-lg bg-purple-700 px-2 py-1 font-sans font-semibold text-white focus:ring active:bg-purple-600"
      onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}
    >
      You clicked me {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
